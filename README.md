# Salary Analysis of Data-Related Jobs  
## Project Background
This study analyzes 969 data-related job records extracted from a dataset of 6,500+ records. The goal is to provide insights into job availability, educational requirements, experience levels, and salary trends across different roles. This analysis aims to help individuals better understand the job market and make informed career decisions based on their backgrounds.
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, was compiled from multiple sources, including surveys, job postings, and publicly available records.
## Executive Summary
This study analyzes 969 data-related job records, focusing on Leadership, Data Analyst, and Data Science roles due to data limitations in other categories.
Data Science has the highest representation (515 individuals) with an average salary of $164,099, primarily held by PhD graduates (71.26%). Data Analysts (391 individuals) earn an average of $120,606, with most holding a Bachelor’s degree (79.8%). Leadership roles (58 individuals) have the highest salary at $204,827, with 100% holding a PhD.
Salary growth is tied to experience, with Data Scientists progressing from $108,636 (5 years) to $240,000 (25 years). Promotions in Data Analysis show a 200% salary increase from Junior to Senior roles. Leadership salaries rise steadily with experience, reaching $220,000 at 20 years.
The most common job title is Data Scientist (453 records), followed by Data Analyst (363 records). Senior and leadership roles appear less frequently but offer higher earning potential.

## Data Preparation
### Handling Missing Data
The dataset contained 6,699 entries after cleaning. Since data was imported from Excel to SQL, empty rows were removed before analysis.
### Correcting Import Errors
During import, the "age" column had encoding errors, resulting in garbled text. This issue was corrected, and the column name was restored.
### Standardizing Inconsistent Values
The "Education Level" column contained variations such as "Bachelor's Degree" and "Bachelor’s", which were standardized for consistency.
### Dealing with Duplicate Entries
Approximately 4,913 duplicate entries (70% of the dataset) were identified. Since removing them would significantly reduce the sample size, they were retained for reference but flagged in the analysis to prevent skewed insights.

## Clarifying Questions, Assumptions, and Caveats
*	Salary trends are primarily influenced by education and experience, though factors like location, industry, and company size also contribute.
*	The dataset includes 969 job records from a larger dataset of 6,500+, which may not fully capture all job markets.
*	Leadership and Data Engineering roles are underrepresented (58 and 4 records, respectively), limiting insights for these roles.
*	Salary growth is based on averages across job titles and may vary depending on job responsibilities and industry.
*	This dataset was sourced from Kaggle and may contain data from several years ago. Therefore, this report does not reflect the most up-to-date job market trends but provides an analysis based on the available dataset.
